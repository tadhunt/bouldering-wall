# Assets and Licenses
Filename | License | Notes
-------- | ------- | -----
Bouldering-Wall.skp | TAD-2BSD, TRIMBLE-3DW | First version (see git history) Inspired by Make magazine "Backyard Climbing Wall" (http://makezine.com/projects/make-43/outdoor-climbing-wall/.  Latest iteration (the one I actually built) is an indoor wall, and includes a 40° overhung moonboard (well, as much as fit into my garage.  It's full width, and height goes up to row 13 of 18). Plus additional vertical and overhung sections.  The design is mine, but it contains assets from the Trimble 3d Warehouse, and is thus covered by both licenses.
Lot-Overview.skp | TAD-2BSD, TRIMBLE-3DW | Property overview with structures & landscaping.  Contains assets from `Bouldering-Wall.skp` and `Lemon tree.skp`
Lemon tree.skp | TRIMBLE-3DW | A Lemon Tree Asset from Trimble 3D Warehouse
